A person is sitting cross-legged at the base of a tree, holding a lit-up square object in front of where their face would be. The individual is surrounded by a dark, outdoor setting with illuminated round lights scattered in the background, possibly fairy lights or small lanterns. The person appears to be wearing a dress or a skirt, and their hair is long, reaching down to their waist. The pose suggests a relaxed or contemplative demeanor.
