In the image, there are four individuals sitting on the edge of a pool with their feet in the water. From left to right: the first individual is wearing a black and red full-sleeve wetsuit; the second individual is wearing a patterned swimsuit in black, white, and shades of pink; the third individual is wearing a black wetsuit with red detailing on the sides; the fourth individual is wearing a black and turquoise wetsuit with short sleeves. They are facing a body of water, likely the ocean, which is visible in the background under a blue sky with scattered clouds. There is a splash of water in the air in front of them, indicating movement in the water. The pool edge appears to be white, and the individuals are seated on a wet surface, suggesting recent activity in the water.
