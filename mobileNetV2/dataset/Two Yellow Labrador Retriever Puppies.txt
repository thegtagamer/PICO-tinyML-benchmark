Two yellow Labrador Retriever puppies are sitting on the grass surrounded by orange flowers. The puppy on the left is slightly leaning forward with its tongue out, while the one on the right sits more upright, also with its tongue out. Both puppies are looking towards the camera, and they appear to be in a relaxed and happy pose.
