A person with long blonde hair is standing by a white railing, overlooking a vast landscape of green hills and valleys. They are wearing a denim jacket, a green shirt visible at the waist, and what appears to be a red bracelet on their left wrist. Their right hand is resting on the railing, and their pose suggests they are gazing out into the distance. The sky above is partly cloudy.
