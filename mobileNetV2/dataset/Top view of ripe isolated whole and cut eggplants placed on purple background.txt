The image shows five eggplants placed horizontally in a row on a purple background. The first and last eggplants are whole and have a dark purple skin with green caps. The three eggplants in the middle are sliced in half lengthwise, revealing the white flesh and seeds inside. The eggplants are arranged symmetrically with the whole ones on the outside and the sliced ones in the center.
