This image features an adult peacock, a type of bird, in mid-jump over a brown concrete wall. The peacock's long, colorful tail feathers are trailing behind as it leaps. The bird's wings are slightly spread, and its legs are extended towards the wall it is jumping over. The peacock is the main subject, and its role is to depict movement, specifically the action of jumping.
