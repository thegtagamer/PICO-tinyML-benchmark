A woman is standing outdoors, holding a straw bag in her hands. She is wearing a pink floral dress with a knee-length hem. Her hair is styled to shoulder length. The background features a body of water, possibly a lake, with lush green trees on the far side. The woman's pose is relaxed, standing straight with her body facing the camera, and her hands gently holding the bag in front of her.
