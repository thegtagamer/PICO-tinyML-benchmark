A person with short blonde hair, wearing a brown plaid coat and carrying a black shoulder bag, is walking down a city street with a small dog on a leash. The person's back is to the camera, and they are walking away from the viewpoint. Other pedestrians are walking in the distance, and buildings line the sides of the street.
