This image features a solitary female subject sitting on a wooden dock by a body of water. Her pose is one of contemplation or sadness, as she has her head bowed down, her arms wrapped around her legs, and her legs pulled close to her body. Her hair is short and she is wearing a short-sleeved top and shorts. The time of day appears to be either dawn or dusk due to the soft lighting and the warm tones in the background. The background is slightly blurred, emphasizing the subject in the foreground.
